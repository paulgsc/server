//! The waker — which discovers, and does not decide.
//!
//! The distinction from a cron is the whole design. A scheduler wakes up and
//! asks "should anyone be nudged?", which means the clock is the thing
//! producing work, which means every guard in the resulting policy is about
//! *time* and none of them is about *why*.
//!
//! This loop asks a much smaller question:
//!
//! ```sql
//! SELECT subject_id FROM engagement_gate WHERE eligible_at <= now
//! ```
//!
//! `eligible_at` was **solved** when the last signal arrived — the instant that
//! subject's engagement will decay to the threshold, computed once, by
//! arithmetic, and written down. So on a day when nobody has drifted, this
//! returns nothing and the pass costs one index probe. Nothing is polled toward
//! and no charge is ticked.
//!
//! The interval below is therefore not a schedule. It is the resolution at
//! which already-decided work is picked up, and shortening it makes
//! interventions land closer to their solved instant without changing which
//! ones happen.
