# NoobGit Watcher Demo

Welcome to the **NoobGit Watcher Demo**! This directory is a simple setup to test and observe the behavior of the NoobGit file system watcher.

## Overview

This demo directory allows you to test how the `NoobGit` file system watcher reacts to changes such as file creation, modification, and deletion. It demonstrates the core functionality of NoobGit's ability to monitor directories and process filesystem events.

## Prerequisites

Before running the demo, make sure you have the following:

- **Rust** installed on your system.
- The **NoobGit** repository set up locally.
- A functional `NoobGit` watcher build.

## Running the Demo

1. **Clone the NoobGit Repository** (if not done already):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/noobgit.git
    cd noobgit
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Demo Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd demo
    ```

3. **Run the NoobGit Watcher**:

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin noobgit
    ```

4. **Interact with the Directory**:

    - **Create new files**: Use a text editor or command line to add new files to the `demo` directory.
    - **Modify files**: Make changes to existing files.
    - **Delete files**: Remove files from the directory.

5. **Observe Output**: The NoobGit watcher will output logs and notifications whenever a file is created, modified, or deleted. This allows you to verify how it processes filesystem events.

## Example Usage

- Create a new file:

    ```bash
    touch new_file.txt
    ```

- Modify a file:

    ```bash
    echo "Adding some text" >> existing_file.txt
    ```

- Delete a file:

    ```bash
    rm unwanted_file.txt
    ```

## Features Tested

- **File Creation**: Detect when a file is created within the watched directory.
- **File Modification**: Detect when a file is changed.
- **File Deletion**: Detect when a file is deleted from the directory.
- **Debouncing**: Verify that rapid file changes are consolidated and processed correctly.

## Warnings

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: All code in this demo was generated by a smooth-brained noob. Ask your mom before using it in production!

## Notes

Feel free to modify the demo directory and see how the `NoobGit` watcher responds. Happy testing!
