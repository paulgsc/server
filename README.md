# Rust Dedicated Server

## Overview

A multi-crate Rust workspace built around `file_host`, an Axum service backed
by SQLx repositories, a Redis/NATS JetStream pipeline, and WebSocket
transport. It's the backend evidence behind
[`paulgsc/some-ui`](https://github.com/paulgsc/some-ui)'s résumé claims — the
table below maps each claimed area to where it actually lives in the tree, so
a claim can be checked against code rather than taken on faith.

| Area | What's implemented | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTTP API** | Axum routes with a generated, tested route inventory — a compile-time check parses the route registrations in source and fails on anything undeclared, stale, or duplicated (deliberately source-level, not a live-router probe, since that would need a fully booted SQLite/NATS `AppState`) | [`apps/servers/file_host/src/routes`](./apps/servers/file_host/src/routes), [route inventory](./apps/servers/file_host/docs/route-inventory.md) |
| **SQLx repositories** | Typed repositories with compile-time-checked queries and paired migrations, one crate per domain (activity, capture, engagement, mood event, presence, push, session) | [`crates/db`](./crates/db), [`migrations`](./migrations) |
| **Redis caching** | A dedup/cache layer fronting read-heavy lookups, independent of the NATS job pipeline below | [`crates/some-cache`](./crates/some-cache), [`apps/servers/file_host/src/cache.rs`](./apps/servers/file_host/src/cache.rs) |
| **NATS JetStream jobs** | Async pipeline jobs (e.g. tab-capture processing) published from Axum handlers, with explicit ack/nak/redelivery semantics on retryable failures | [`crates/some-transport`](./crates/some-transport), [`crates/push_kit`](./crates/push_kit) |
| **WebSockets** | Restart-aware connections with heartbeat/staleness detection and broadcast isolation; shutdown disconnects every tracked connection and gives cleanup a fixed grace window (individual removals aren't themselves timeout-bounded) | [`apps/servers/file_host/src/websocket`](./apps/servers/file_host/src/websocket), [`crates/ws-connection`](./crates/ws-connection), [`crates/ws-conn-manager`](./crates/ws-conn-manager) |
| **Overload controls** | Token-bucket rate limiting, load shedding, and timeouts, with rejection tracked as a first-class fault condition rather than inferred from resource pressure | [`apps/servers/file_host/src/rate_limiter`](./apps/servers/file_host/src/rate_limiter), [fault conditions](./docs/fault-conditions.md) |
| **Observability** | Prometheus metrics and dashboards that render missing data as *unknown*, never as healthy by default | [`apps/servers/file_host/src/metrics`](./apps/servers/file_host/src/metrics), [dashboard honesty](./docs/dashboard-honesty.md) |
| **Tests against real dependencies** | Real SQLite databases and in-memory WebSocket-actor tests run directly, not mocked. NATS integration tests exist but skip themselves when no broker is reachable, and neither NATS nor Redis is provisioned in this repo's CI — see Status and limitations | [`crates/db/activity/tests`](./crates/db/activity/tests), [`crates/ws-connection/tests`](./crates/ws-connection/tests) |

## Status and limitations

No users, no traffic. This is a single-engineer workspace, exercised by its
own test suite and CI rather than by production load — every row above means
"the code demonstrates this," not "this has been operated at scale." See
[`docs/fault-conditions.md`](./docs/fault-conditions.md) for what is
instrumented and what isn't, and [`docs/WARNING.md`](./docs/WARNING.md) for
the standing caveat on trusting any of it blindly.

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) doesn't provision Redis or a NATS broker, so
the NATS-dependent tests in `crates/some-transport` skip themselves there
(they run for real against `docker-compose`'s NATS service locally), and
`crates/some-cache` currently has no test suite that exercises Redis itself
rather than its in-process helpers.

`Cargo.toml`'s `[workspace] members` list is the source of truth for exact
crate membership; the grouping above is a map to orient from, not a
duplicate of it.

## Requirements
* Rust (latest stable) and Cargo
* SQLite — every `crates/db/*` repository builds with SQLx's `sqlite`
  feature only; migrations live under [`migrations/`](./migrations)
* A running Redis instance and NATS server with JetStream enabled —
  `file_host` connects to both at startup (`AppState::build`) and won't
  come up without them (see [`infra/compose`](./infra/compose))

Nix covers the Rust/SQLx/SQLite toolchain above, not the Redis/NATS
services — those still need to be running separately:
```bash
nix develop  # default shell: Rust + dev tools + Whisper + audio libs
```

[`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) defines five shells — `default`, `rust`, `ci`,
`whisper`, and `llm` — see [Nix Development Environment](./nix/README.md)
for the first three.

## Development

What [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](./.github/workflows/test.yml) runs on a
clean checkout — order matters, since `sqlx::query!` checks SQL against a
real schema at compile time, so the database has to exist and be migrated
before `prepare`/`check`/`test` will build at all:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite://$PWD/dev.db"
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run --source migrations
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Clippy isn't part of that workflow. `.github/workflows/lint.yml` runs
`cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings --no-deps` but is currently paused
(scoped to a `foo` branch, not `main`). As a local check before pushing,
this repo's own `CLAUDE.md` recommends scoping it to whatever package
you're touching, with flags `lint.yml` doesn't pass:

```bash
cargo clippy -p <changed-package> --all-targets --keep-going --no-deps
```

The generated HTTP route inventory that [`paulgsc/some-ui`](https://github.com/paulgsc/some-ui)'s
contract harness consumes:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://$PWD/dev.db" make routes  # regenerate routes.server.{json,ts}
make routes-check                                # assert the inventory still matches the routers
```

Local dependencies (Redis, NATS, Prometheus/Grafana, `file_host`,
`orchestrator`) are composed via [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml)
and [`infra/compose`](./infra/compose).
